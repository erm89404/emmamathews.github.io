		<h2>the cutest aquatic mustelids in town</h2>
		<P>Otters, as you may already know, are pretty swell creatures. They hold paws while floating down the river so as not to get separated, which is pretty freakin' adorable.</p>

		<p>Now, there are different kinds of otters. There are otters that live in rivers and those that live in seas, so naturally the two types are river otters (<i>Lontra canadensis</i>), and sea otters (<i>Enhydra lutris</i>). Different species of otters look similar, but they're <em> not even the same genus!</em></p>
		
		<p>Sea otters are much larger than river otters, and spend all of their time in the water while their freshwater counterparts spend half their time on land. Sea otters are the ones that engage in the quintessential "otter" pose, floating on their backs in the water. So, if a river otter and a sea otter were to throw down, who would win the fight?</p>
		
		<p><select>
			<option value="Select" selected>Select Otter</option>
			<option value="river otter">River Otters! They're small, quick, and crafty.</option>
			<option value="sea otter">Sea Otters! They're bigger, stronger, and definitely the superior mustelid.</option>
		</select>
		
		<button type="submit">Submit</button>

		<p>Awesome! Now, here are some more specifics on the differences between River and Sea Otters.
